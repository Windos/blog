New Year’s Resolutions are the in thing, right? Since one of mine is to blog more… I might as well turn my resolutions for 2017 into a post. If you’ve been here in the past, you know my slant, this list will be PowerShell heavy.

## The list, in no particular order despite the numbers

1.  **One blog post a month**, but preferably two. I really enjoy this blogging business, but it’s been struggle to find the time to sit down and do it justice. That needs to change this year, so on the list it goes!

2.  **Take lunch breaks**. I have a bad habit of working through lunch. We’re not talking eating at my desk, I just ignore that it’s even a thing that happens and that probably isn’t healthy. This year I’ll make an effort to get out of the office for an hour every day, assuming there are no crisis happening.

3.  **See if any locals are interested in a PSUG**. I’m fairly certain my employer would be open to allowing the use of one of our meeting rooms for a PowerShell User Group, all that we’d need is people. I’m not saying I’ll start a user group… but if it happens, it happens. I’m will commit to doing some fact finding to see if there is an interest out there.

4.  **Submit session (or two) for consideration at the 2018 PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit**. Two years ago the instructor of a course I was on, who was getting ready to do a session at the NZ Ignite conference, told me he thought I’d do well speaking at conferences… this was the first time I’d ever actually considered it. It’s on the other side of the planet but the summit, with the community I’m working to get more involved with, would be a good first opportunity to do so.

5.  **Provide regular updates to BurntToast**. I have a long list of features (and tons of help) to be added to [BurntToast](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast). But, just like the blog posts, they take time I can’t seem to nail down. I’m aiming to get out at least a minor update once a month, until I consider it “feature complete” after which I’ll squash bugs as they come in (please do open issues on GitHub, it’s an awesome feeling to know people are using it.)

6.  **Start streaming again**. A while ago [I live streamed](https://www.livecoding.tv/windos/) my PowerShell work on livecoding.tv and actually ended up with a surprising number of followers despite being a rather niche topic on a niche website. At the time I was the only person doing PowerShell on there, I’m sure that’s changed by now. I haven’t decided if I’ll return to livecoding.tv (erm, sorry, liveedu.tv) or if I’ll move over to YouTube, either way I’m sure it’ll help with achieving the previous goal.

7.  **Learn DSC and Pester**. This is probably self-explanatory, I’m just going to do it
