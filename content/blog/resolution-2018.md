Woah, 2017 flew by. I may not have achieved everything on my [New Year's Resolutions list](https://king.geek.nz/2017/01/06/resolution-2017/) from last year, but it did help me focus some of my efforts and I'm glad I put the list together.

To start off 2018, let's revisit see what (if anything) got completed and set a new list for a new year.

## 2017, With Hindsight

1.  **One blog post a month**. The only month I didn't do a post was February, but otherwise I'm happy with the frequency of posts.
2.  **Take lunch breaks**. I didn't exactly go outsideâ€¦ or eat, but I did force myself to at least switch to doing personal stuff (normally PowerShell) during my lunch hour. I consider that progress.
3.  **See if any locals are interested in a PSUG**. I didn't do much on this actively, though it is a fairly small IT community locally and the percentage of that community interested in PowerShell probably isn't actually that large. I did start attending virtual user group meetings, which has been awesome!
4.  **Submit session (or two) for consideration at the 2018 PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit**. I ended up submitting two session proposals for consideration and one, "[Whip Your Scripts into Shape: Optimizing PowerShell for Speed](https://powershelldevopsglobalsummit2018.sched.com/event/Cq9V/whip-your-scripts-into-shape-optimizing-powershell-for-speed)", was accepted! Let this be an example putting your ideas forward being worth it.
5.  **Provide regular updates to BurntToast**. What was I thinking? One minor update a month? Yeah, that didn't happen. 2017 saw four updates being released which were downloaded over 6,000 times.
6.  **Start streaming again**. I took the plunge in November and started streaming PowerShell content on YouTube and have been having a lot of fun with it. If you're at all interested, please do check out my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYEhLc_oOaOoT9lACEWYOCA).
7.  **Learn DSC and Pester**. Work bought the [DSC](https://leanpub.com/the-dsc-book) and [Pester](https://leanpub.com/pesterbook) books on LeanPub, which I've started reading. I didn't do any actual work with DSC last year, but I did make an effort to start writing Pester tests for my various scripts at work.

## New Year, New Resolutions. The 2018 List

1.  **Two blog posts every month**. I've started building momentum and I have a growing list of ideas, why not aim for more posts?
2.  **Speak at PSUG**. I imagine this would end up being a virtual thing, but if the opportunity to present in person came up, I certainly wouldn't say no.
3.  **Do a community lightning demo at the PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit**. I'm already attending and speaking at the summit, why not take the opportunity to show off [BurntToast](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/BurntToast) in action while I'm there?
4.  **Find, and stick to, a streaming schedule**. This will help make the streaming thing a habit and help viewers know when they can expect me to be online. Both good things.
5.  **Configure a (production) server with DSC**. It's one thing to learn about it, let's aim to actually use it
