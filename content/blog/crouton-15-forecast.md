One of the more recent features added to the [BurntToast](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/BurntToast) module is "[AdaptiveGroups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/adaptive-interactive-toasts?tabs=builder-syntax#adaptive-content)", which are referred to as Columns within the module.

My first use case for this was showing information about the music I'm listening to. It's a good way to visualize how these groups work.

As you can see the bottom of this toast notification is occupied by two columns, stacked side by side.
