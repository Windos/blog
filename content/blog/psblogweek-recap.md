Yesterday was the end of the latest [#PSBlogWeek](http://psblogweek.com/). It was a great event, with five days worth of awesome PowerShell content coming out!

This is my recap of the week, with links to all of the articles (and bloggers) and my main takeaways.

## Monday

**[Automating Chocolatey package internalizing with PowerShell][Post 1] by [Dan Franciscus](https://twitter.com/dan_franciscus)**

First up on Monday, Dan discussed tooling for automating the process of getting [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) packages loaded into your company's private repository. This included identifying outdated packages and testing that they successfully install.

This post reminded me that I really need to give [Chocolatey for Business](https://chocolatey.org/pricing) a proper look.

**[Logging and Error Handling Best Practices for Automating Windows Update Installs (MSU) with wusa.exe (And For Logging Any Called Process)][Post 2] by [Darwin Sanoy](https://twitter.com/DarwinTheorizes)**

Also on Monday, Darwin shared some of his logging (and error handling) best practices. The article is aimed at wusa.exe, but the takeaways from it can be applied everywhere! The main takeaway for me was that I need to up my logging game.

## Tuesday

**[Creating Storage Reports With PowerShell][Post 3] by [Me!](https://twitter.com/WindosNZ)**

Since this was my article I won't "review" it; if you're reading this then chances are pretty high that you've already read it.

## Wednesday

**[Using Desired State Configuration (DSC) Composite Resources][Post 4] by [Josh Duffney](https://twitter.com/joshduffney)**

I'm just starting on my Desired State Configuration (DSC) journey at work, so the timing of Josh's Wednesday post was great for me. He covered Composite Resources: what they are, how to create them, and how to use them.

## Thursday

**[Migration of SQL Server with PowerShell dbatools][Post 5] by [Volker Bachmann](https://twitter.com/VolkerBachmann)**

Thursday saw Volker demonstrate SQL Server migration with the [dbatools](https://dbatools.io/) module. My work tasks don't generally extend very far into the "application" layer, especially where SQL is concerned so the dbatools module haven't been too far up on my person "to learn" list. This post, however, made me realise I need to send some info through to our applications team.

## Friday

**[Using PowerShell to create a vCloud Director Tenant HTML Report][Post 6] by [Markus Kraus](https://twitter.com/vMarkus_K/)**

And wrapping up the week on friday, Markus created HTML reports for vCloud Director. I've had no exposure to this particular VMware product... but regardless holy cow those reports look good!

I'm certainly going to be making use of [PowerStart HTML](https://github.com/tdewin/randomsamples/tree/master/powerstarthtml) early next week.

## Thanks

Fist of all thanks to [Adam](https://twitter.com/adbertram) for putting on the event and to all of the bloggers for taking part and producing some awesome content.

But also, thanks for the wider PowerShell (and possibly non-PowerShell) community out there who read the articles, provided feedback, and liked, shared or otherwise interacted with all of us on various social media sites.
