      <description>My passion has always been tech. Growing up my neighbour&amp;rsquo;s old computers often found their way to me, and I have fond memories of building myself a 486DX2 &amp;ldquo;gaming pc.&amp;rdquo;
That computer was when I leant about the capacitors in power supplies. It turns out that if you&amp;rsquo;re swapping the fan in one of those for one with LEDs in it you probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t twist the wires together by hand. Who&amp;rsquo;d have known?</description>

      <description>A couple of years back Adam Bertramorganized several people in the tech space to write &amp;ldquo;How I Work&amp;rdquo; blog posts. These were based on the format set out by Lifehacker, where we had a common set of questions to answer. My previous post is linked below.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering an updated post for a while now, especially since I have moved jobs in the interim. The tipping point that finally got this post rolling was New Zealand going into lockdownto work towards eliminating COVID-19.</description>

      <description>I did one of these New Year&amp;rsquo;s posts back in 2017and 2018&amp;hellip; but for some reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to doing one in 2019 despite calling it outon New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get this train back on track then and have a look back at the past 12 months and publicly list some goals for the next 12.
Looking Back at 2019 Personally and professionally, 2019 was a huge year that I will never forget.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re now about half an hour away from October, at least here in New Zealand, meaning that it&amp;rsquo;s just about time for Hacktoberfest2019 to kick off.
This will be my fourth Hacktoberfest, and with any luck the fourth event t-shirt for my wife to eventually claim (not by my choice though!) I&amp;rsquo;ve written about the event a couple of times in the past, in 2017 and 2018.

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m humbled, shocked, and proud to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve been granted Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award in the Cloud and Datacenter Management category. I join an awesome group of people that I&amp;rsquo;ve looked up to (AND STILL DO!) for years.
For those interested in the numbers, New Zealand has a pretty small pool of MVPs that I&amp;rsquo;m jumping into. Excluding myself, there&amp;rsquo;s currently 28 peopleacross all award categories, and only threeunder the Cloud and Datacenter Management banner.</description>

      <description>New Zealand is one of the first countries to see in the New Year. Though I&amp;rsquo;m not usually the type of person to specifically stay awake past midnight to see the calendar change myself. It has, however, got me into a mood to look back on the past year.
In the next day or two, I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing my resolutions for 2019 (including looking back at this year&amp;amp;rsquo;s ones), so this isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be along those linesâ€¦ instead I wanted to touch on one thing that&amp;rsquo;s been really important to me.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s October again, meaning it&amp;rsquo;s time for Hacktoberfest. It&amp;rsquo;s the fifth time this event has been run, and it&amp;rsquo;s the third time I&amp;rsquo;ve taken part.
The super quick primer on how the event works is:
Register on the Hacktoberfest site, authenticating with your GitHub account. Find projectsyou want to contribute to. Send through five pull requestsduring the month of October. Earn an awesome t-shirt! What&amp;rsquo;s more, Microsoft is also joining Hacktoberfest-ivities.</description>

      <description>As with a lot of things I blog about, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many other people have found themselves looking for solutions to this particular problem.
One of my main PowerShell projects is BurntToast, a module for generating toast notifications. A large part of toasts are their sounds and I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with this when doing demos via Skype for Business.
The first time I realised this, I was in the middle of an &amp;ldquo;alarm clock&amp;rdquo; demo and I was making a joke about subjecting the audience to an annoying ringing noise&amp;hellip; only to be told in chat that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear it.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re not aware, I&amp;rsquo;ve recorded a bunch of videosfor Adam Bertram&amp;amp;rsquo;snew learning resource/platform TechSnips. Most of these videos were done prior to the service going live in early June and since then the number of contributors has expanded quite a lot.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had some questions about my setup from those just getting into recording, or getting in a submission. The aim of this post is to document my environment, settings, and workflow with the hope that it can help those wanting to become TechSnips contributors (or heck, even those wanting to get into YouTube or livestreaming.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s not shown in this (very old) video is the pair of air horns that fired off to announce the &amp;ldquo;explosion.&amp;rdquo; Those things were seriously loud, you didn&amp;rsquo;t want them going off while you were in the middle of defusing.
I bring all this up because I have fond memories of hacking out some code and not knowing for sure that it will work until it was loaded up, and run, on the PICAXE.</description>

      <description>Planet PowerShellis an aggregator of community blogs. Looking back at the commit history, it looks like this blog has been hooked up to it for a little over a year.
However the recent move back to Ghostresulted in my posts not coming through to Planet PowerShell. This little hiatus made me realize more than ever the value of the site.
If you have a #PowerShell blog, I can&amp;#39;t overstate how valuable it is to get your feed hooked up to @planetpshell!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I worked on a PowerShell project &amp;ldquo;for myself.&amp;rdquo; By that I mean creating a script to automate something that I might do myself, in my personal life rather than at work.
This morning I was up at 4 AM, live streamingthe creation of a script to automatically pick a random tweet from my archive and Tweet out a link to it.

      <description>It feels odd writing this post so soon after documenting my blogging workflow. Over the past two days this blog has migrated from GitHub Pagesto a self hosted Ghostinstall.
A Little History This blog, or at least the earliest posts on it, started on Ghost. This was back when the cost of their hosted services was very cheap. If memory serves, it was around the $5/month mark.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty slack on blog posts over the past two weeks or so. As it is, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this one on my lunch hour and hoping to get it done before it&amp;rsquo;s over.
Why the crunch? In a roundabout way you can blame Adam Bertram.
Adam has been working on a new e-learning service and I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting a fair amount of time into recording content for it, along with many other contributors.</description>

      <description>Coming out of the PowerShell &amp;#43; DevOps Summitand PowerShell Conference Europethere has been a noticeable uptick in new blogs. I&amp;rsquo;ve also noticed a number of people saying &amp;ldquo;I want to get into it&amp;hellip; but need to figure out x and y first.&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to document my workflow (which is sadly lacking in obvious opportunities for automation) for writing blog posts and a little about the backend this blog runs on.</description>

      <description>After another three flights, and 16 hours in the air, I&amp;rsquo;m back home in New Zealand. I can certainly say that the change in time zones has hit me harder coming back. Going over to Bellevue, I got right into things and felt (for the most part) normal.
Last week I did a blog post for each dayof the PowerShell &amp;#43; DevOps Global Summit, going over what I took part in that day and what my main takeaways were.</description>

This&amp;rsquo;ll be the last of my recap posts, and in a couple of days I&amp;rsquo;ll be following up with a &amp;ldquo;this was Summit, and you should be there next year&amp;rdquo; type post.

Seriously, this isn&amp;rsquo;t normal. My day started by nearly storming off to reception to complain that they&amp;rsquo;d left the toilet blocked courtesy of the previous guest. Luckily a quick Google short circuited that.
This is really something the travel websites should warn people about!

This seems like a decent excuse for a &amp;ldquo;State of the Blog&amp;rdquo; post covering what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to recently and what is coming up soon.

These guidelines were finalized in June. I first found out about NIST&amp;rsquo;s guidelines via Sophosand it really captured my imagination.
