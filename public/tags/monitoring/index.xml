      <description>The Pitch In my last postI showed how you could extend the possible alerts generated by Pulsewaywith PowerShell and Windows&amp;rsquo; Event Log.
The example used, checking to see if a disk was present within the operating system, was just the tip of the iceberg (and rather mundane.)
In this mini post I&amp;rsquo;ll list 20 more ideas for PowerShell fuelled Pulseway alerts.
Disclaimer from last post: Be careful about over saturating yourself with notifications.</description>

Check Need to know when your servers data drive is running out of free space?</description>
