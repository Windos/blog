      <description>A little over a year ago, the United States National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) released a draft of SP 800-63 &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Digital Identity Guidelines&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. These guidelines were finalized in June. I first found out about NIST&amp;rsquo;s guidelines via Sophosand it really captured my imagination.
(Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m including a few hyperlinks in this post. Consider them references and additional reading if you&amp;rsquo;re want to find out more.)</description>

      <title>A Very Octocat U2F Key</title>

      <description>Earlier this month GitHub announced, in partnership with Yubico, that they now support FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) as an option for two-factor authentication alongside their existing support for Google/Microsoft Authenticator Apps. With the announcement came a special offer: a special edition, Octocat adorned, Yubico U2F key for only $5!
A deal too good to pass up, especially as someone that has around ten services listed in their phone&amp;rsquo;s Authenticator app.</description>
